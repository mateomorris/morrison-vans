				<h2>Models</h2><p>A cutaway van chassis is a variation of the full size van which was developed for use by second stage manufacturers. Such a unit has a van front end, and driver controls in a cab body which extends to a point aft of the front seats, where the rest of the van body is cutoff (leading to the terminology "cutaway"). From that point aft, only the chassis frame rails and running gear extend to the rear when the unit is shipped as an "incomplete vehicle". A second stage manufacturer, commonly known as a bodybuilder, will complete the vehicle for uses such as recreational vehicles, small school buses, minibuses, type III ambulances, and delivery trucks. A large portion of cutaway van chassis are equipped with dual rear wheels. Second stage manufacturers also add a third weight-bearing single wheel "tag axle" for larger minibus models.</p><p><br></p><p>The term van may also refer to a minivan. Minivans are usually distinguished by their smaller size and front wheel drive powertrain, although some are equipped with four wheel drive. Minivans typically offer seven or eight passenger seating capacity, and better fuel economy than full-sized vans, at the expense of power, cargo space, and towing capacity. Minivans are often equipped with dual side sliding doors</p><p><br></p><p>The precursor to American vans would be the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_delivery">sedan deliveries</a>&nbsp;of the 1930s to late-1950s. The first generation of American vans were the 1960s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_van">compact vans</a>, which were patterned in size after the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2">Volkswagen Bus</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Greenbrier">Corvair</a>-based entry even imitated the rear-mounted, air-cooled engine design.

The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_A100">Dodge A100</a>&nbsp;had a similar layout and could accommodate a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine">V8 engine</a>. Chevrolet also switched to this layout. The Ford, Dodge and Corvair vans were also produced as pickup trucks.</p>
